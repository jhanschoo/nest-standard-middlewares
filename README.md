# nestjs-standard-middleware

Boilerplate for including standard ExpressJS middleware into a NestJS project as a submodule following a NestJS paradigm. Just import this package and add this module as a dependency to your `app.module.ts`.

# TODO

- [ ] Refactor to set all options to `undefined` before freezing options.
- [ ] Document API and how to pass parameters.
- [ ] Make it possible for consumer to choose which middlewares to (or not to) use.
